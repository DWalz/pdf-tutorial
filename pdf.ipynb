    "## Data Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the deep dive into the PDF document structure, knowledge about the syntax of data in PDF.\n",
    "There are data types like strings or numeric values.\n",
    "Those are simple enough and will be introduced when they are first used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is however three types of data and the method of referencing objects that needs to be examined beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Name objects are atomic objects that are uniquely defined.\n",
    "This means that two Name objects that consist of the same characters are one and the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Names begin with a `/` which is followed by arbitrarily many alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "They are usually used to denote keys in dictionary objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "/Name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays in PDF are one-dimensional collections of PDF objects.\n",
    "They are delimited by square brackets (`[]`) while the objects inside are separated by whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ 1 200 /Name ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary objects are a collection key-value pairs.\n",
    "The key of any pair has to be a name object, the value may be any kind of data.\n",
    "Dictionaries are delimited by `<< >>` and the pairs inside by whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "<<\n",
    "    /Name   /Foo\n",
    "    /Age    23\n",
    ">>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referenced Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Any object within a PDF file can be marked as referenced / indirect object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is identified by an identifier, which consists of two parts, the object number and the generation number.\n",
    "The object number is a unique number for the object, while the generation number specifies in which generation of the document the object was created.\n",
    "In a newly created PDF file each object has generation number 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This identifier is the followed up by the object that shall be refernced, surrounded by the keywords `obj` and `endobj`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can then be referenced by its object number, its generation number and the keyword `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "1 0 obj\n",
    "<<\n",
